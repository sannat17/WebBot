# Welcome to WebBot!
This repository contains code for a multi-purpose web bot that I am building using Selenium and Python.

I am using the chromedriver to automate browser tasks so make sure to install the latest version of Chrome before using the code in this repository.

# What are its uses/ applications?
The bot can be used to automate the following:
## Instagram tasks:
 - Logging in
 - Collecting followers/ following data

## Basic web tasks:
